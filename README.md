## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS (only supported OS currently)  
- VSCode or preferred code editor  
- Docker  
- Roboflow Account  
- BlueStacks  
- Python 3.11  

### Installation

1. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a Roboflow account & workspace, then get your API key.

3. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhilipWilliamVentura/ClashRoyaleBot.git
cd ClashRoyaleBot
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
WORKSPACE_NAME=your_actual_workspace_name
```

5. Fork Roboflow workflows: Troop Detection, Card Detection & Tower Detection, then update .env with your workspace names.

Go in Docker terminal
6. Install inference-cli
```bash
pip install inference-cli
```

7. Start the Inference Server:
```bash
inference server start
```

### Setup BlueStacks
